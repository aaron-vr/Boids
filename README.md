# Boids

*I've been reading some books on artificial life and self-organisation and decided to implement this simple simulation of birds in flight.*

Boids, as described by their creator, Craig Reynolds, represent bird-oid (or bird-like) objects that display flocking behaviour similar to that of birds. 

This small programme I wrote using SFML and C++ simulates the movement of boids in two dimensions and abides by the three rules put forth by Reynolds in his 1987 paper titled [Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37401.37406).

The rule are as follows: 

1. Separation 

2. Alignment 

3. Cohesion
